Based on the the game, the user will arbitrarily import the dot coordinates to be drawed in a 20x20 plot that is mimicing the drawing shown in the game. The user will also need to identify the dots that are connected by the lines.
The program will export the plot showing the dots and the line for the user to verify if should start over or should process forward with computing the solution.

import number of dots
import locations of each of dot
import lines
show user the graph to verify
start computing the result

The solution is shown in two ways:
1). Show in graph where line with arrows are shown to indicate the drawing order
2). Show in text as the vectors in order
